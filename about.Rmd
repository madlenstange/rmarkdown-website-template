## Header

I’m a biodiversity researcher strongly rooted in evolutionary biology. I’m trained in molecular biology, bioinformatics, and evolutionary biology (B.Sc and M.Sc.), taxonomy and morphology (PhD), and acquired ecological knowledge and a deep interest in eco-evolutionary dynamics (Postdoc). As a biodiversity researcher, I aspire to deepen our understanding of ecosystems dynamics, identify and protect endangered species, and promote sustainable conservation strategies that balance human needs with environmental health. My specific strength lies in my broad education, training, and interests– from fieldwork to generating morphological and molecular data to the bioinformatic analyses and interpretation of that data. My aspiration lies in taking holistic approaches including a species’ natural history, evolution, morphology, and ecology.
